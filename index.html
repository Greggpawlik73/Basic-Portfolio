		<p>My name is Gregg and I'm a quick witted smarth mouth.  I enjoy many different things, expecially quoting movies.  I'm constantly looking for new things to learn and new adventures to take.  I've lived in four different states over the past 10 years.  My favorite city I've lived in so far has been San Diego which is German for Whale's Vagina.  San Diego has beautiful weather all year round and you're close enough to drive to the beach, mountains, or the desert within a couple of each other.  I have fun with everything I do I don't really take anything serious as there is no need to.  I'm enjoying life a city at a time and hopefully very soon getting to explore Europe.</p>
